# hello-world
Working thru Quickstart for repositories in GitHub.
My name is Kim Morgan. I have been developing software using Visual Basic for over 20 years. Now I am seeking to gain proficiency in C++, Python, and possibly C#. I have looked into using GitHub in the past, but never got familiar with it. Instead, I used an Excel spreadsheet and regular software backups to maintain a record of development progress.
